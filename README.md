## 🌍 About the Event

DevSecCon 2025 brought together developers, security professionals, and AI practitioners from around the world to explore how the software development lifecycle is evolving in the age of AI.

**Core theme:** As AI transforms how we build, ship, and secure software, security must evolve to be *AI-native* — embedded into workflows, not bolted on later.

### 🔑 Highlights
- **Keynotes**
  - *Future of Development: Building Securely at the Speed of AI* – Peter McKay (Snyk CEO)
  - *From Code-Centric to Agent-Centric Development* – Guy Podjarny & Danny Allan
  - Expert talks on *securing AI agents*, *red-teaming generative AI*, and *defending non-human identities*
- **Tracks**
  - *Build and Secure with AI* (hands-on demos)
  - *AI Security Deep Dives*
  - *Snyk Innovation Showcase* featuring new agentic-security tools
- **Community**
  - 30+ global DevSecCon chapters in 20+ countries
  - Focus on collaboration, open source, and shared learning

## 🤖 The AI Security Developers Challenge

One of the most exciting features of DevSecCon 2025 was the **AI Security Developers Challenge** — a global competition designed to test real-world skills in securing AI-native applications.

### 🧠 Challenge Overview
- A fast-paced, collaborative hackathon where developers and security engineers teamed up to tackle AI-related security problems.
- Participants were encouraged to use creative, agentic, and open-source approaches to address emerging AI threat models.
- Promoted *“learning by doing”* through real-time coding, testing, and securing of AI workflows.

### 🏆 Winners
While Snyk has not yet published the official winners’ list publicly, the challenge drew impressive participation from across the DevSecCon community.  
Future updates and winning projects are expected to be shared through Snyk’s community channels.

> 💡 *Stay tuned for updates — when the official winners are announced, this section can be expanded with project details.*

## 🧭 Personal Reflections

Attending DevSecCon 2025 reinforced that:

- Security needs to evolve **at the same pace as AI innovation**.  
- Developers are now working not just with code — but with **agents, models, and data pipelines** that must be secured from design to runtime.  
- Hands-on challenges like the AI Security Developers Challenge are key to building real-world defensive expertise.  
- The community’s openness and collaboration are what make DevSecCon special.
